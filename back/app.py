        Clara Whitman
        Background: The family's devoted caretaker, Clara was closer to Mr. Blackwood than anyone else. He confided his plans to her, revealing that he wanted her to oversee the company's legacy. This attachment, however, pushed her to a deadly decision when she learned of Alice and Bob's schemes.

        Location: Claims she was in the grand hall tending to guests, but witnesses say she was seen entering the study multiple times.

        Intent to Kill: When she discovered that Alice and Bob intended to usurp Mr. Blackwood's wishes for the company, Clara believed the only way to protect his legacy was to eliminate him.

        "Dont reveal all the clues at once and reveal only through stories one at a time"-Clues:
        Broken Picture Frame in the Study : In the study, a picture frame with Mr. Blackwood and Clara's photo lies shattered, symbolic of their bond. Clara handled it earlier, leaving fingerprints, but dismisses it as an accident.
        Letter Opener : Clara's fingerprints are on the bloodstained letter opener hidden near the study. She subtly tries to redirect suspicion by suggesting it might have been placed there to frame her.
        Perfume Scent in the Kitchen : Clara's distinct perfume lingers in the kitchen, where she says she “might have passed by earlier” but denies being there near the time of death.
        Suspicious Muddy Shoes : Clara points out muddy shoes near the back entrance, implying they belong to Bob, who she says was “acting nervous.” This misleads the detective, suggesting Bob entered the manor from outside.
        Fabric Scrap on the Balcony : Clara “discovers” a torn fabric scrap on the balcony that she claims matches Alice's dress. This fake clue diverts suspicion toward Alice and her unknown activities on the balcony.
        Opinions of Others:

        Alice: “She's always conniving. Mr. Blackwood never trusted her completely, and I understand why.”
        Bob: “Bob always had issues, especially with his brother's success. I worry his motives may not be pure.”
                Welcome to Ravenswood Manor, a grand yet ominous estate enveloped in shadow and intrigue. Mr. Reginald Blackwood, a wealthy and enigmatic figure, was found dead in his study on a stormy night. He held a powerful company whose future was filled with promise—but also peril. This future was to be overseen by someone he trusted deeply, but his decision was unknown to all but a select few.
                The primary suspects are:
                Alice Clarkson - Mr. Blackwood's ambitious business partner, known for her ruthlessness in pursuit of power.
                Bob Blackwood - Mr. Blackwood's estranged brother, who returned with financial troubles and a desperate need for a fresh start.
                Clara Whitman - The family's longtime caretaker and Mr. Blackwood's trusted confidante, who was closer to him than anyone realized.

        Alice Clarkson
        Background: Mr. Blackwood's business partner, Alice is sharp, driven, and ruthlessly ambitious. She's seen as the company's powerhouse, but recent tensions with Mr. Blackwood about the company's future were common knowledge.

        Location: Claims she was reading in the library, but witnesses say she was in the garden shortly before Mr. Blackwood's death.

        Intent to Kill: Alice was furious after learning Mr. Blackwood intended to give Clara control of the company. She believes his decision would ruin the firm and her career, giving her motive to eliminate him.

        "Dont reveal all the clues at once and reveal only through stories one at a time"-Clues:
        
        The Broken Glass in the Dining Room: Alice admits to accidentally knocking over a glass after a heated discussion with Mr. Blackwood earlier in the evening, but she insists Clara witnessed it and is framing her.
        Suspicion Toward Bob: Alice says she heard Bob and Mr. Blackwood arguing earlier about money. She believes Bob is hiding something, casting doubt on his alibi.
        The Garden Locket: Alice “finds” a locket with Mr. Blackwood's initials in the garden and slyly mentions it to you, subtly implying that Clara had a personal bond with him. This locket confirms Clara's deep attachment, hinting at her motive to protect his legacy.
        Opinions of Others:

        Bob: “Bob's in over his head and desperate. A person like that will do anything if it helps him.”
        Clara: “She's a sweet talker, always too close to Blackwood. If anyone could influence his mind, it was her.”

        Background: Mr. Blackwood's financially troubled brother, Bob returned to Ravenswood Manor recently after years of estrangement. Desperate for help, he hoped to convince his brother to help him financially, but their meeting did not go as planned.

        Location: Claims he was in the billiard room alone, though there's evidence he was also near the kitchen and basement.

        Intent to Kill: Bob had a clear motive: Mr. Blackwood's refusal to help him financially only worsened his desperate situation. However, rather than act himself, he points toward Alice as the likely culprit.

                The Missing Document: Bob claims to have seen Alice taking a document from the study—a supposed transfer of the company to Clara. He implies that Alice would have wanted to eliminate Mr. Blackwood to prevent this transfer.
                The Garden Footsteps: Bob recalls hearing someone in the garden around the time of the murder and insists it was Alice, hoping to cast her as the murderer.
                Shadow in the Kitchen Window: Bob says he saw Alice's reflection near the kitchen, suggesting she was sneaking around suspiciously. However, the details are hazy, and it's unclear whether Bob is trying to divert attention.
        Opinions of Others:

        Alice: “Alice would stop at nothing to get control. She's manipulative, and I'm sure she'd do whatever it takes to secure her position.”
        Clara: “Clara's always loyal, but perhaps too loyal. She's fiercely protective of Mr. Blackwood's wishes, though I wonder if she'd go so far as to harm someone for them.”}
