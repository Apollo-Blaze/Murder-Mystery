   - The chatbot reveals new information that can be added to the **notepad**.
   - **Toast notifications** pop up when key discoveries or actions take place.

3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Examine the crime scene for forensic evidence (e.g., blood samples, fingerprints).
   - Forensic findings are logged in the notepad and can help in making deductions.

4. **Unlocking Clues**:
   - As the investigation progresses, users unlock new clues through interactions and exploration.
